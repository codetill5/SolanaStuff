Ethereum as a general purpose blockchain so instead of being a blockchain for one application, its a blockchain that you can build any application on top of and the way that you do this on ethereum is you write a piece of code and you create a digital transaction that contains that piece of code and publish it and when you publish this transaction and that transaction gets included into a block on the blockchain this creates an object called a contract.
